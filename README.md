# Sparse Neural Network (SNN) for horse face classification
The proposed Sparse Neural Network is composed of three layers; an input layer (gradient features), a sparse hidden layer and an output layer for feature classification.
The input layer represents the gradient feature vector. The sparse hidden layer had a size equal to the input layer. Each neuron in the input layer had a unique relationship with the opposite neuron in the hidden layer. This layer was trained using a proposed sparse feature selection method.
